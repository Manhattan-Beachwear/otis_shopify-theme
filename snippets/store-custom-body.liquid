  Store-specific body scripts hook.
  
  This snippet is rendered before the closing </body> tag of layout/theme.liquid.
  Child stores should populate this file with store-specific scripts such as:
  - Chat widgets
  - Post-load analytics
  - Custom JavaScript initialization
  - Other third-party scripts that need to load in the body
  
  IMPORTANT: This file must be protected in Child store .gitattributes with:
  snippets/store-custom-body.liquid   merge=ours
  
  See README.md for deployment configuration details.
